Powershell Scripts To Build AD, IIS &amp; 50 Users
This is version 01 of my attempt to automate the build process of Active Directory for my home lab.

As Windows Server can be used for 180 days, I have created these scripts to help with the process of having to rebuild each time.

Run each step as Administrator.

I have tested this on Windows 2019 and Windows Server Core.
